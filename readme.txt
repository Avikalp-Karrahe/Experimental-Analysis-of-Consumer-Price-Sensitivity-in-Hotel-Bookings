Designed and analyzed a randomized pricing experiment across several U.S. markets to measure how changes in hotel prices affect consumer booking behavior on Expedia. We varied prices for logged‑in users (with known income) and collected two key outcomes—whether they booked and how many nights they stayed. After conducting model‑free exploratory analyses, we fitted regression models to estimate price elasticity overall and by destination and income segment, and compared these experimental estimates to prior observational benchmarks (≈20% drop in booking probability per $100 increase). Results were delivered in a two‑page report—complete with labeled tables, figures, and R code—providing actionable insights on consumer responsiveness and segment‐specific pricing strategies.
